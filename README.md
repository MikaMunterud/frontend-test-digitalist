# **Project description**

This project was created as an Internship evaluation test based on the following requirements.

## **Instructions**

* You should create a landing page according to the attached design sketch.
* We also have a Use Case that we would like to see how you would think to solve it.
  * Our customer wants a menu and a search box that appear nicely when you click on the respective icons. Unfortunately, we have not received a design sketch for this and therefor give you free hands to create a concept for how the menu and the search box could look.

### **Requirement specifications**

1. According to design
2. Menu, the structure should have two depth levels.
3. Be responsive.

We are happy to use Sass (SCSS, which we use preferably at Digitalist) and some form of CSS methodology.

We would encourage you to not use jQuery and instead build the JavaScript you need using some other modern libraries or frameworks in case you need them.

You may otherwise choose which which techniques you want to use, we do not add any evaluation in it but will first look at how well-written code is.
